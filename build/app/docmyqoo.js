He wants to eat, learn to cook, have some healthy exercise, play board games, make friends, maybe fall in love… Can you be the perfect dragon-parent to him? Remember, always keep him fed!!\n\n## Components\n\n- 14x Activities card\n- 20x Collection cards\n- 1x Happiness tracker card\n- 1x Actions reminder player aid\n- 1x Happiness token\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Get your smartphone (or other preferably touchscreen device) that has internet, and go to [https://pocketdragon.co.uk/](http://pocketdragon.co.uk/). Put it on the table between the players, to the side.\n2. Select the difficulty of the game (Easy, Medium, or Hard).\n3. Place Happiness tracker card to the other side of the play area, and place the Happiness token on it.\n    1. If playing Easy: put it on 4.\n    2. If playing Medium: put it on 3.\n    3. If playing Hard: put it on 3.\n\n4. Shuffle the Collection cards and lay them out face down in a 4 by 5 grid between the players.\n5. Shuffle the Activities cards to form a draw deck.\n6. Both players draw 3 cards from the deck, and they hold it in a way that the other player can see the cards (especially the icons on the top) but they can’t see their own cards themselves.\n7. Make sure you know the rules, as you won’t have time to look them up while the timer goes!\n8. Hit START on your smartphone.\n\n## Rules of play\n\nPlayers take turns alternatingly, as fast as they can. On your turn, you may carry out one of the following actions:\n\n- Look at 2 face down Collection cards in the grid. You may not tell the other player what you saw.\n- Ask for a general clue about an icon. Say “Which of my cards have Endurance (grey) icons?”, to which the other player will point at all your cards that have at least one grey icon on. This action is only available if the General Clue button is available in the app. Press the button when taking this action.\n- Ask for a specific clue about a card. Say “Name one icon on this card!”, while pointing at one of your cards. To which the other player will answer, for example, “Attention (green)”. They cannot say how many, or what else, and can only name one icon. This action is only available if the Specific Clue button is available in the app. Press the button when taking this action.\n- Play an Activity. You pick a card from your hand and put it down on the table (Note: This is the first time you’re seeing that card). You will then see the 2 or 3 skill icons that Activity requires of you.\n    - You then have to flip 2 or 3 face down cards from the grid (depending on how many are on the card), matching each of the icons on the played card.\n    - Once you successfully flipped all but one (1 of 2 or 2 of 3) of the required icons, you may ask your partner to suggest a card to flip. (As they might know where one of the required icons are.)\n    - Once you successfully matched all 3 icons, discard all face up cards from the grid to the collection discard pile, and put the completed Activity to the side. Press the “Log Success” button in the app. If this is the last required Activity (as shown by the app), the Dragon gets very happy, and you have won the game.\n    - If you (or your partner) make a mistake, decrease the Dragon’s Happiness by one (on the tracker) and keep trying, discarding the mistaken card.\n        - If the mistake was made by your partner, they can keep suggesting other cards to look at.\n        - If the Happiness was already on zero, you instead lose the game.\n\n    - After flipping at least 1 card over, you may stop trying at any time and just remove the Activity from play, and discard all revealed collection cards.\n    - If you haven’t won or lost the game, draw a new Activity card, and orient it towards your partner (without you looking at it, obviously). If you can’t draw one (because the draw pile is empty), you have lost the game.\n\n- Collect Food. Flip a face down card face up in the grid, and put it in front of you with the Food side up. You may not take this action if you already have 4 food cards in front of you.\n    - It is suggested to organize the collected cards by matching food icons.\n\n- Feed the Dragon. This action is only available if the “Feed” button is enabled in the app.\n    - Press the “Feed” button to reset the hunger timer.\n    - Discard all cards of one type of collected Food cards from in front of you. (For example if you have 2 sushi and 1 hazelnut spread, you may discard either the 2 sushi or the 1 hazelnut spread). The discarded cards go to the collection discard pile.\n    - Increase the Dragon’s Happiness by one less than the number of Food discarded. (For example if you’ve discarded 3 steaks, increase the Happiness tracker by 2.)\n    - Note: the app will turn the hunger timer red for the last 30 seconds of it. If the timer runs out, you lose the game!\n\n- Tidy Up. You can only take this action if there are 5 or fewer face down cards remaining in the grid.\n    - Collect all face down cards from the grid and shuffle them together with the collection discard pile. Note: Do not shuffle collected Food cards back at this time.\n    - Quickly lay these cards out in a grid, as close to a 4-by-5 one as possible.\n    - Decrease the Dragon’s Happiness by one (he hates tidying up). If the Happiness was already on zero, you instead lose the game.\n\n### Rules of Communication\n\nYou may talk with your partner as much as you wish, except:\n\n- You may not divulge which face down card has which icons\n- You may not give more information about your partner’s cards other than what the clue-giving action allows. You may however remind your opponent of information they already asked for after giving a new clue (don’t cheat!).\n- You may not tell your partner which action they should take, or which Activity they should play from hand. It is okay to discuss strategy and timing regarding feeding and tidying up.\n- You can examine the collection discard pile at any time and communicate its contents to your partner.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe game ends in defeat if:\n\n- You need to decrease Happiness when Happiness is zero. (Note: Not when happiness reaches zero. Happiness is essentially the number of mistakes / tidy up actions remaining you can have/use.)\n- You forget to feed the Dragon in time.\n- The main timer runs out.\n\nThe game ends in victory if you complete the required number of tasks before any of the loss conditions trigger.\n\nYou can then determine your score:\n\n- Base score: Easy: 1, Medium: 3, Hard: 8\n- For each remaining Happiness: +1\n- For each remaining ten seconds on the main timer: +1\n\nIf you can score above 10, you’re really good, if you can score above 15 you’re amazing.\n\n## Credits:\n\nGame Design: Dávid Turczi and Wai-yee Phuah\n\nWith a little help from: Jonathan Gilmour and Adrian Schmidt\n\nSpecial thanks for playtesting to: Nick Shaw, Neil HK, Anthony Howgego\n\nThanks to Richard Ham (rahdo) and Tom Heath (slickerdrips) for the review videos.\n";var o=Object.freeze({pocketDragon:t,anachrony:"\n### The&nbsp;Sentry&nbsp;Post\n\nDesigned by Dávid Turczi with Viktor Peter and Richard Amann. Graphics by Villő Farkas.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the main board, within reach of all players.\n\nGameplay: It is a new Hex space available to use in Phase 5 (Action Rounds). Its action is: The player may remove all Free Action markers from their player board (including from buildings and superprojects on their player board), making the Free Actions (and the markers) available again. Additionally, power up an exosuit at no cost (if able), and score 1 victory point.\n\nAny worker may be placed here without restriction. Only a single exosuit may be present here at any given time.\n\nWhen playing against the Chronobot solo opponent, the Chronobot takes this location (but still gaining 2 water and scoring 1 victory point) the first time per round it is unable to take any other action.\n",trickerion:"\n### The&nbsp;Secret&nbsp;Workshop\n\nTrickerion designed by Viktor Peter and Richard Amann; Secret Workshop designed by Dávid Turczi, Viktor Peter and Richard Amann. Art & graphics by Villő Farkas.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the main board, within reach of all players.\n\nGameplay: It is a new location to use during Place Characters phase. A single character can be assigned here (that gains +1 Action Point), by using any Workshop assignment card (including Special Assignment cards). The normal Workshop actions are NOT available here, but instead a new Action is available:\n\nExpert Preparations - for each spent AP, the player may place one Trick Marker on one of their Tricks (where component requirement is met), regardless of the AP cost of that Trick’s preparation, or whether there are Trick Markers already on that trick.\n\nWhen playing against the Dahlgaard’s Heir solo opponent (requires Dahlgaard’s Academy expansion), the Heir attempts to place in this location whenever sending to the Workshop, and treats it as a contested location as long as both the player and the Heir has an Workshop assignment card played, but its character not yet placed.\n",petrichor:"\n### The&nbsp;Swarming\n\nPetrichor designed by David Chircop; Petrichor: Honeybees & The Swarming designed by David Chircop & Dávid Turczi. Art by Daniela “iella” Attard, graphics by Sami Laakso.\n\nRequires Petrichor: Honeybees expansion to play.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the play area, within reach of all players.\n\nGameplay: Any player may take a Swarming action, by discarding any one card. This can be first or second action, including after a player has passed. Each player (including the one who triggered Swarming) may then choose to gain 1 honey. For each player who chose to take honey, the triggering player may add one drop directly to the tile where the Bee is currently present. Afterwards, remove the Swarming card from play, it may not be triggered again in the game.\n\nVariant Gameplay (for players without Honeybee expansion):  Any player may take a Swarming action, by discarding any one card, as long as there is at least one tile with no cloud and no drop on it. This can be first or second action, including after a player has passed. Each player (excluding the one who triggered Swarming) may then choose to draw 1 card. For each player who chose to draw, the triggering player may add one drop directly to one tile with no cloud and no drop on it. Then, they may add an additional drop to the same tile. Afterwards, remove the Swarming card from play, it may not be triggered again in the game.\n\nWhen playing against the Southern Winds solo opponent, the Swarming is not available to use.\n",daysOfIre:"\n### Printing&nbsp;Press\n\nDays of Ire designed by Mihály Vincze, Dávid Turczi & Katalin Nimmerfroh; Printing Press designed by Mihály Vincze & Dávid Turczi. Graphics by Sami Laakso.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the main board at the beginning of day 3, as close to Blaha Lujza Square as possible. Do not add any fighters to this location at setup.\n\nGameplay: It is a new location, pieces can move to the same as any other location on the board, it is only adjacent to Blaha Lujza Square though. It has a printed event that can be solved by the Revolutionary player(s) the same way as any other event. If the event is solved, the location is removed from play (and its printed effect performed). If the event is not solved by the end of the game, it counts against the events on the board, and triggers its printed penalty effect.\n\nThe Printing Press is supported both in Zhukov and Conflict modes, in any player counts.\n",nightsOfFire:"\n### Radio&nbsp;Broadcast\n\nDesigned by Brian Train & Dávid Turczi. Graphics by Zak Eidsvoog.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the main board, as close to District 5A as possible.\n\nGameplay: When a Revolutionary player is taking a move action, for 1 ops they may move a single fighter between District 5A and the Radio card. Once a fighter is moved onto the Radio, it is immediately revealed (and stays revealed if it moves back to District 5A). As long as there is at least one fighter present, the Revolutionary player(s) gain 1 momentum at the end of each round (immediately before the Adjustment Phase), and each time a civilian is arrested.\n\nFighters on the card still count as units in District 5A and can be targeted by attacks there.  The card is removed from play when it first empties after at least one fighter was present on it.\n\nInsurgents on the Radio are NOT hidden at the end of the round.\n\nIf playing against the Konev automated opponent, units on the Radio count double for the purposes of calculating threat, and are dealt damage to first.\n\nFor added thematic flair, as long as there is at least one insurgent on the Radio card, play Beethoven’s Egmont Overture very loudly.\n\nWhen playing Days & Nights campaign mode (Red Army Pack expansion required), the Radio Broadcast is only available for play, if the Making Pamphlets event on the Printing Press promo was solved in day 3-5.\n\nThe Radio Broadcast is supported both in Zhukov and Conflict modes, in any player counts.\n",redacted:"\n### The&nbsp;Transporter&nbsp;Room\n\n[redacted] designed by: Mihály Vincze, Dávid Turczi & Katalin Nimmerfroh; The Transporter Room designed by Dávid Turczi. Art by Katalin Nimmerfroh, graphics by Todd Sanders.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the main board, as close to the Tunnel Entrance as possible.\n\nGameplay: This is a new location, adjacent to the Tunnel Entrance (and to the Tunnel Exit, if playing with the Garden Party expansion). It’s action is the Transporter: as an action move to any room, anywhere on the board. If that room is not empty, trigger sneaking out rules. Using the Transporter triggers the Computer Room’s ability, allowing the active player to be hacked (similarly how using the Radio would).\n\nThe Transporter Room has no yellow border, therefore there are no interactions here when the lights are out.\n\nFor added thematic flair, say “One to beam down” every time you use the Transporter.\n",microfilms:"\n### The&nbsp;Honeymooners\n\nDesigned by David J. Mortimer & Dávid Turczi. Art by Mihajlo “The Mico” Dimitrievski, graphics by Todd Sanders.\n\nSetup: Place this card in the middle of the table, within all players’ reach.\n\nGameplay: During their turn, any player may pay 1 franc to draw a card from the top of the draw deck. This is NOT an action, can only be done once per turn, but cannot be done after discarding down to hand limit. Place the spent coin on the Honeymooners card. (Thematically, they’re running a con, and handing out cards for money.)\n\nWhen any player takes a Steal action they can choose: steal 2 francs from any other player (as before), OR steal all francs from the Honeymooners. There is nothing more satisfying than conning the con artists after all...\n",diceSettlers:"\n### Married&nbsp;Bliss\n\nDesigned by Dávid Turczi. Graphics by Agnieszka Kopera.\n\nSetup: Place this card amongst the Technology cards, as an additional available one. It does not count towards any of the categories.\n\nGameplay: Married Bliss can be acquired like any other Technology, for 3 research icons. At the end of the game (besides its printed 3 VP) it scores 1 point for every pair of tents the player has on a tile. Houses do not count, and two tents on two different tiles do not count as a pair. (Four tents on a single tile however count as two pairs.)\n\nWhen playing against the Diceoneer solo opponent, it acquires Married Bliss like any other Technology card (but only scores the printed VP, same as always).\n",kitchenRush:"\n### Wedding&nbsp;Cake\n\nDesigned by Dávid Turczi with Vangelis Bagiartakis. Graphics by Konstantinos Kokkinis.\n\nKitchen Rush: Piece of Cake expansion required to play.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the deck of orders, if the players agree to take the Wedding Cake Challenge.\n\nGameplay: Any player one can take this card without a Waiter action (and get the plate for it). The first layer of the cake has to be done by the end of the round in order to progress in the Wedding Cake Challenge. If unfinished, do not lose prestige, etc. If finished, return the card to its original place along with the plate and ingredients that completed the first layer. During the following round(s) any player (including the same or different one than the one that made the first layer) may take the card and the previous layer to make the next layer. The next layer’s plate has to be placed on top of the first layer, and moved together. When the second layer is finished, repeat the procedure for the third layer as well. Note, in a single round only a single layer can be made.\n\nOnce all 3 layers have been completed (which can be at the end of the third or fourth round), players gain 10 money and 3 prestige. If the Wedding Cake Challenge is not completed by the end of the fourth round, the game ends in defeat. This is in addition to the normal victory conditions.\n",tashKalar:"\n### Love&nbsp;Elemental\n\nTash-Kalar designed by Vlaada Chvátil; Love Elemental designed by Dávid Turczi. Art by Jakub Politzer, graphics by Filip Murmak.\n\nSetup: Place this card next to the deck of legendary cards.\n\nGameplay: The Love Elemental can be summoned by discarding any legendary card while matching the pattern of the Love Elemental. Once summoned by either player, remove it from play.\n\nIf the players would prefer to NOT know whether the Love Elemental is in play, it is alternatively recommended to pick (randomly or by agreement) one legendary card which is essentially replaced by Love Elemental. (Possible suggestion is the Fire Elemental, since it has similar pattern.) If so, the Love Elemental can only be played when a player discards the agreed upon legendary.\n\nIf playing with Open Legends variant, either add it as one of the three starting legendary cards, or agree upon one legendary to replace (see above), and when that card is revealed replace it with Love Elemental on the display.\n\nNote: Love Elemental is a semi-unofficial promo, and while permission is given by CGE, it is not endorsed as an official part of the game.\n"});class i{constructor(){this.pocketDragon="",this.promos=[{name:"anachrony",displayName:"Anachrony"},{name:"trickerion",displayName:"Trickerion"},{name:"petrichor",displayName:"Petrichor"},{name:"daysOfIre",displayName:"Days of Ire"},{name:"nightsOfFire",displayName:"Nights of Fire"},{name:"redacted",displayName:"[redacted]"},{name:"microfilms",displayName:"[microfilms]"},{name:"diceSettlers",displayName:"Dice Settlers"},{name:"kitchenRush",displayName:"Kitchen Rush"},{name:"tashKalar",displayName:"Tash-Kalar"}],this.converter=new window.showdown.Converter}showRules(){this.rulesDialog.show()}componentWillLoad(){this.pocketDragon=this.formatMarkdown(t)}componentDidLoad(){this.rulesDialog=new n(this.htmlElement.querySelector("#rules-dialog"))}componentDidUnload(){this.rulesDialog.destroy()}getPromoRules(e){return this.converter.makeHtml(o[e])}render(){return e("aside",{id:"rules-dialog",class:"mdc-dialog"},e("div",{class:"mdc-dialog__surface"},e("header",{class:"mdc-dialog__header"},e("h2",{class:"mdc-dialog__header__title"},"Game Rules")),e("section",{class:"mdc-dialog__body"},e("div",{class:"dialog-body"},e("span",{innerHTML:this.pocketDragon}),this.promos.map(a=>e("app-collapsible-section",{class:"clearfix"},e("h2",{slot:"header"},"Promo Rules: ",a.displayName),e("div",null,e("img",{src:`/assets/promo-${a.name}.jpg`,class:"promo"}),e("span",{innerHTML:this.getPromoRules(a.name)})))))),e("footer",{class:"mdc-dialog__footer"},e("pd-button",{class:"mdc-dialog__footer__button--accept",label:"Close",primary:!0}))),e("div",{class:"mdc-dialog__backdrop"}))}formatMarkdown(e){return this.converter.makeHtml(e)}static get is(){return"app-rules"}static get properties(){return{htmlElement:{elementRef:!0},pocketDragon:{state:!0},rulesDialog:{state:!0},showRules:{method:!0}}}static get style(){return".mdc-dialog{display:-webkit-box;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;position:fixed;top:0;left:0;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center;width:100%;height:100%;visibility:hidden;z-index:5}.mdc-dialog__backdrop{background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.87);background-color:var(--mdc-theme-text-primary-on-light,rgba(0,0,0,.87));position:fixed;top:0;left:0;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;justify-content:center;width:100%;height:100%;opacity:0;z-index:-1}.mdc-dialog__surface{-webkit-box-shadow:0 11px 15px -7px rgba(0,0,0,.2),0 24px 38px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.14),0 9px 46px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.12);box-shadow:0 11px 15px -7px rgba(0,0,0,.2),0 24px 38px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.14),0 9px 46px 8px rgba(0,0,0,.12);background-color:#fff;background-color:var(--mdc-theme-background,#fff);display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-box-orient:vertical;-webkit-box-direction:normal;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;width:calc(100% -
